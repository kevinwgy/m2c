A sphere penetrating through a thin-walled circular cylinder at 500 m/s. The sphere and the cylinder are both filled with fluid.

The two videos in `results` are obtained with `RiemannNormal = Mesh` and `Average`, respectively. The 'scissor' effect (when sphere makes contact with and penetrates through the left wall of the cylinder) appears to be sensitive to `RiemannNormal.

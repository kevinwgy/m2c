This is the simulation shown in Section 5 of S. Islam, A. Narkhede, P. Asimow, J. Michopoulos, and K. Wang, IJSS 2025. Figures 14 and 15 in the paper can be replicated. 

Note that in the input file, the coefficient "C" in the temperature law of NASG for SLG is set to 
2.0613e2 mm3/g, while in the paper the reported value is 1.97 mm3/g. The small discrepancy was due
to roundoff in gamma (long story short). Anyway, the coefficient values in the input file were 
used to generate the results shown in Figures 14 and 15 in the paper.

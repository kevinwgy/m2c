This is an example case that simulates the dynamics of a containment
structure that is subjected to an internal explosion. The initial
conditions within the confinement structure are provided through
the text file `SphericalShock.txt`. 

For details regarding the simulation setup, refer
`Fluidâ€“structure coupled simulation framework for lightweight explosion
containment structures under large deformations` by Narkhede et. al.

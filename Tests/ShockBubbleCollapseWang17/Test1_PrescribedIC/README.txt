Simulation of shock-induced bubble collapse near a rigid wall. 
Replication of the test case shown in Section 4.3 of K. Wang, 
"Multiphase Fluid-Solid Coupled Analysis of Shock-Bubble-Stone
Interaction in Shockwave Lithotripsy," IJNMBE 2017, also shown
in S. Cao et al, "Shock-Induced Bubble Collapse Near Solid 
Materials: Effect of Acoustic Impedance," JFM 2021 (Figure 13,
the rigid wall case)

In this example, the shock wave is prescribed as initial condition.

Step 1: Compile the user-specified initial condition file in "IC".
        (See the header of the .cpp file.)
Step 2: Run M2C with input.st. (See log.out for reference.)

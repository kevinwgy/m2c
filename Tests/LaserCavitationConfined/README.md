This directory contains several example simulations of laser-induced cavitation
in a confined region bounded by a circular cylinder/tube. Compared to the
examples in LaserCavitationZhao24, these simulations have a longer time
window, and employ a simple phase transition kinetics model that allows
the energy convertion to complete within a finite amount of time (instead
of instantaneously).

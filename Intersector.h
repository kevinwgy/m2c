/****************************************************************
 * Class Intersector is responsible for tracking a triangulated
 * surface within a fixed Cartesian mesh. A collision-based
 * algorithm is used, similar to the one presented in
 * Wang et al., IJNMF, 2012. The intersector is able to find
 * (1) nodes covered by the interface (occluded nodes),
 * (2) all the edge-interface intersections,
 * (3) shortest distance from each node to the interface (usually
 *     only a few layers of nodes near the surface)
 * (4) closest point on the interface to each node (If solution is not
 *     unique, only one solution is found)
 * (5) nodes swept by the (dynamic) surface in one time step
 * (6) the "color" of each node (i.e. connectivity info)
 * (7) the elements in the embedded surface that form the boundary
 *     of a "color", and their inward-facing side.
 * Note: The above results are stored within this class.
